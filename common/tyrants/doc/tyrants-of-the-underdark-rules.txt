TYRANTS OF THE UNDERDARK - RULES
==================================

GAME OVERVIEW
-------------
Tyrants of the Underdark is a competitive strategy game for 2 to 4 players in which you take on the role of the leader of a drow house. Your goal is ascension to greater power through control of the Underdark.

During the course of the game, you'll build and play your own deck of cards that represent the minions of your house and determine what actions you can take on your turn, such as recruiting new minions or deploying troops to the game map. You'll continually refine your deck, adding new cards while removing others to make your deck more powerful.

SETUP
-----
1. Place the game board within easy reach of all players. Depending on the number of players, you'll play on the entire game map or only part of it. The board is divided into three sections by a dotted line.
   - 2 Players: Don't play on the outer sections; play only on the center section.
   - 3 Players: Choose one of the two outer sections; play only on that section and the center section.
   - 4 Players: Play on all 3 sections.
2. Choose 2 of the market half-decks (40 cards apiece) and shuffle them together to form the market deck. Put it face down in the marked space on the board.
3. Put the Priestess of Lolth and House Guard cards face up in their marked spaces on the board.
4. If you're playing with the Demons half-deck, put the Insane Outcast cards face up in their marked space.
5. Put the top 6 cards of the market deck face up in the market.
6. Put white (unaligned) troop pieces in all troop spaces marked with an X on the portion of the game map you're playing on.
7. Put the site control markers in their marked spaces on the game map with the "total control" side face up.
8. Place the VP tokens in the marked space on the board.
9. Randomly choose who will take the first turn and give that player the first-player marker.
10. Each player does the following:
    - Choose a drow house and take the playmat, inner-circle board, and all pieces of that house's color. Place them in front of you.
    - Take 7 Noble cards and 3 Soldier cards to create your own starting deck. Shuffle your deck and place it face down in the marked space on your playmat.
    - Draw 5 cards from your deck.
11. Starting with the first player, each player deploys a troop in any starting site on the game map not already taken by another player. Starting sites are those with black boxes.

First Game: For your first game use the Drow and Dragon half-decks.

PARTS OF A CARD
---------------
Each card has the following parts:
1. Name
2. Cost: How much Influence you must expend to recruit the card.
3. Aspect: Minions represent different aspects of drow society, as shown by their card symbols.
4. Minion Type: What type of creature the minion is.
5. Deck Symbol: Which market half-deck the card belongs to.
6. Rules Text: What the card does when you play it.
7. Story Text: Gives some insight into the minion's story, but has no effect on gameplay.
8. Deck VP Value: How many victory points the card is worth in your deck, hand, or discard pile at the end of the game.
9. Inner-Circle VP Value: How many victory points the card is worth in your inner circle at the end of the game.
10. Rarity: How many times you'll find the card in a half-deck. A card with 2 dots has 2 copies in its half-deck.

ASPECTS
-------
- Ambition: Best at recruiting other minions and creating a strong inner circle.
- Conquest: Best at taking over the Underdark.
- Malice: Flexible and best at assassination.
- Guile: Best at spying and disrupting control.
- Obedience: Gets the day-to-day tasks done.

RESOURCES
---------
The resources in the game are Power and Influence, which you may expend on your turn to take actions. Power and Influence aren't tracked using game pieces; when you gain them during your turn, you must expend them on that turn or they are lost. You gain Power and Influence primarily from playing your cards.

Power: Allows you to exert control over the Underdark game map. With Power you can deploy your troops, assassinate enemy troops, and return spies.

Influence: Allows you to recruit cards from the game board.

Resource Pool: Whenever you are granted Power or Influence, it goes in your resource pool, and you can expend it whenever you like during step 1 of your turn. At the end of your turn, any resources in your pool that you didn't expend are lost; you can't carry them over to your next turn.

SEQUENCE OF PLAY
----------------
The game is played in a sequence of rounds. During a round, each player takes a turn starting with the first player. Play continues clockwise until the game ends.

YOUR TURN
---------
During your turn, do the following any number of times and in any order you choose:

1. Play a card from your hand.
2. Expend resources from your resource pool to take one of the following basic actions:
   - Assassinate a troop by expending 3 Power.
   - Deploy a troop by expending 1 Power.
   - Recruit a card by expending an amount of Influence equal to that card's cost.
   - Return an enemy spy by expending 3 Power.

At the end of your turn, perform the following steps in order:
1. Promote cards to your inner circle if you played any cards this turn that told you to promote at the end of the turn.
2. Gain VP for your site control markers.
3. Discard your played cards and any cards remaining in your hand.
4. Draw up to your hand size of 5 cards. Whenever you need to draw a card but there are none left, shuffle your discard pile to re-form your deck.

GAINING VP
----------
Whenever you're told to gain VP, take unclaimed VP markers equaling that amount and put them in the trophy hall on your playmat.

PLAYING CARDS
-------------
To play a card, lay it on the table face up in front of you. Follow all the card's instructions in the order they're presented, adding any resources the card grants to your resource pool.

Whenever a card gives instructions that go against the rules of the game, the card takes precedence.

SPECIAL ABILITIES
-----------------
Abilities with Costs (arrow symbol): Whenever an arrow appears in a card's text, it indicates that a cost is required to get an effect. Pay the cost described on the left side of the arrow in order to get the effect described on the right side of the arrow. You may pay the cost only once when you play the card. Paying the cost of an ability is optional. If you don't pay the cost, the ability does nothing.

Focus: The Elemental half-deck features the Focus keyword ability. Whenever you play a card with Focus, if you played another card of that card's aspect this turn or if you reveal a card of that aspect from your hand, you get the Focus effect described after the dash.

INTERACTING WITH THE GAME MAP
------------------------------

PRESENCE
--------
Most actions you take on the game map require you to have Presence where you take the action. You have Presence:
- At any site where you have a spy, a troop, or a troop in a space adjacent to that site.
- At any troop space on a route if that space is adjacent to a site or space where you have a troop.

TROOP SPACES
------------
Troop spaces are the only spaces on the game map that may contain troop pieces.

WHITE TROOP SPACES
------------------
White troops are enemy troops that represent various denizens of the Underdark unaligned with the drow houses. These troops take no actions; they serve only to impede your conquest of the Underdark. Once a white troop is removed from the game map, its troop space becomes available for player troop placement.

SITES
-----
A site has multiple troop spaces grouped together within a single, larger box. Sites may also include:
1. Name: The name of the site.
2. VP Value: The VP value at the end of the game for the player who controls the site.
3. Site Control Marker: Taken by the player who controls the site.
4. Starting Site: Where a player may deploy his or her first troop of the game. Recognized by their black color.

CONTROL
-------
You control a site when there are more troops of your color there than troops of any other single color. You lose control of a site when the number of your troops there becomes tied with or surpassed by another color.

TOTAL CONTROL
-------------
You have total control of a site if all its troop spaces are filled only with your troops and no enemy spies are present.

SITE CONTROL MARKERS
--------------------
A site control marker is a marker you put in front of you to show that you control a site. When you take control of a site that has a control marker, take that marker from the game map or from the site's previous controller and place it in front of you. If control of the site becomes tied, return that site's control marker to the game map.

Once on each of your turns, for each site control marker you have, you get an effect that depends on your degree of control over the site (control or total control). Flip the marker to the appropriate side. You get the indicated effect starting immediately on the turn you take the marker.

ROUTES
------
A route is a path between two sites that contains one or more troop spaces.

ACTIONS
-------

KEY TERMS AND PHRASES
---------------------
- Presence: Most actions you take on the game map require you to have Presence where you take the action.
- Enemy: Cards and rules that refer to enemy troops include both white troops and other players' troops.
- Anywhere on the board: Whenever this phrase appears, it means you don't need Presence where you're told to take the action.

ASSASSINATE A TROOP
-------------------
You may assassinate a troop only where you have Presence. To assassinate a troop, take it from a troop space and place it in the trophy hall on your playmat. You can't assassinate your own troops.

During step 1 of your turn, you may expend 3 Power from your resource pool to assassinate a troop.

DEPLOY A TROOP
--------------
You may deploy a troop only where you have Presence. To deploy a troop, take one from your barracks and place it on an empty troop space. Though unlikely, if you have no troops on the game map, you may deploy anywhere on the board in an empty troop space.

Each time you take this action while you have no troops remaining in your barracks, gain 1 VP instead.

During step 1 of your turn, you may expend 1 Power from your resource pool to deploy a troop.

DEVOUR A CARD
-------------
To devour a card, put it in the space on the game board marked for devoured cards. Devoured cards are no longer part of the game.

If you devour a card in the market, replace it with the top card of the market deck.

DRAW A CARD
-----------
To draw a card, put the top card of your deck in your hand.

Whenever you need to draw a card but there are none left, shuffle your discard pile to re-form your deck.

MOVE A TROOP
------------
You may move a troop only from a space where you have Presence. To move a troop, move it to an empty troop space anywhere on the board (even if you don't have Presence there).

PLACE A SPY
-----------
To place a spy, put it on any site that doesn't already contain one of your spies. Place it near the name of the site - not on one of the troop spaces. You don't need to have Presence at a site to place a spy there. Any number of players can have spies at a single site.

If you take this action while all your spies are already placed, you may either do nothing or first return one of your spies and then place it.

PROMOTE A CARD
--------------
To promote a card to your inner circle, put the card face up on your inner-circle board. Promoted cards are no longer part of your deck; you won't shuffle them back into it.

At the end of the game, you score victory points for cards in your inner circle equal to their inner-circle VP values.

RECRUIT A CARD
--------------
To recruit a card, take it from the game board and put it in your discard pile. Then, if you recruited a card from the market, replace it with the top card of the market deck.

During step 1 of your turn, you may expend Influence from your resource pool to recruit a House Guard, a Priestess of Lolth, or a card from the market. Expend an amount of Influence equal to the card's cost.

If the supply of House Guards, Priestesses of Lolth, or Insane Outcasts runs out, the game continues, but you'll no longer be able to recruit one of those cards. If multiple Insane Outcasts are recruited and would run out, they are recruited in clockwise order starting with the player whose turn it is.

RETURN A TROOP OR SPY
---------------------
You may return an enemy troop or spy only from where you have Presence. To return an enemy troop or spy, return it from a troop space or site to its owner's barracks.

To return one of your troops or spies, return it from a troop space or site anywhere on the board to your barracks.

You may return only forces belonging to a player. (White troops cannot be returned since they do not belong to any player.)

During step 1 of your turn, you may expend 3 Power from your resource pool to return an enemy spy.

SUPPLANT A TROOP
----------------
You may supplant a troop only where you have Presence. To supplant a troop, assassinate that troop and then deploy one of your troops in the newly vacated space.

You may supplant only enemy troops.

ENDING THE GAME
---------------
The end of the game triggers when one of the following occurs:
- A player deploys his or her last remaining troop.
- The market deck is empty.

When the end of the game triggers, play proceeds until the end of the round, at which point the game ends.

FINAL SCORING
-------------
At the end of the game, each player scores VP as follows:
- The VP value of each site you control.
- 2 VP for each site under your total control.
- 1 VP for each troop in your trophy hall.
- The deck VP value for each card in your deck, hand, and discard pile.
- The inner-circle VP value for each card in your inner circle.
- VP tokens gained during the game.

The player with the most VP at the end of the game wins. If there's a tie for most, the tied players each win.
