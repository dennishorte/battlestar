  2x15 fences
  2x4 stables
  2x5 workers

  2 large farm boards (one for each new player)

================================================================
SETUP
================================================================

Set up the game according to the base game rules. Only a few things
change when playing with 5 or 6 players.

The 5th and 6th players take the components in their colors, along
with a farm board. They start with two workers in their house, just
like everyone else.

Add the room tiles provided with this expansion to the base game
tiles. They no longer need to be separated.

Attach the new game board extension to the main game board with the
correct side facing up, matching the number of players shown on it.
(You will not need the base game's extensions.)

The starting player receives 2 food. Every subsequent player
(including the 5th and 6th players) receives 3 food.

================================================================
CARDS
================================================================

MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS
------------------
This expansion includes 8 additional Major Improvements, used only
in the 6-player game. These are essentially extra copies of existing
Major Improvement cards with higher building costs than their base
game counterparts (except the Well).

First, place the base game's 10 Major Improvements on the supply
board. Then place all 8 new Major Improvements beneath their
corresponding base game cards. For the Fireplace and Cooking Hearth,
place the new card behind the more expensive base game card.

Specifically:
  - Place the 4-clay Fireplace behind the 3-clay Fireplace.
  - Place the 6-clay Cooking Hearth behind the 5-clay Cooking Hearth.

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
------------------
Minor Improvements are not tied to player count; simply use the cards
from the base game. They are sufficient for up to 6 players.
Nevertheless, this expansion includes 4 Minor Improvements -- the
L-deck promo cards from "Isle of Skye," winner of the Kennerspiel
des Jahres 2016. You may add them to the base game cards if you wish.

Note: If you use the "Drafting" variant (see the base game appendix,
page 8) with 6 players, each player may choose from a maximum of 8
Minor Improvements. Currently, only the "Young Artist" occupation
allows a player to have more Minor Improvements.

OCCUPATIONS
-----------
Add the 48 occupations from this expansion to the base game
occupations and shuffle them together. Deal 7 occupations to each
player as usual. If you prefer, you may use only the occupations
from this expansion -- they work very well together.

Some new occupations use the following terms:

"Your lone occupation": An occupation with this label may only be
played if you have not played any other occupation, and you may not
play any other occupation after it. If you play it, it must be and
remain your only occupation for the entire game. (Return all your
other occupation cards to the box.) Currently, "Village Idiot" is
the only such card in the game.

"Turning a card face down": Some occupations only provide a benefit
when you choose (at any time) to turn them face down. If you do,
you receive the goods promised by the occupation. The face-down
occupation still counts as a played occupation, but it no longer
provides benefits for the remainder of the game.

================================================================
GAMEPLAY
================================================================

The flow of the game is fundamentally unchanged, but the new action
spaces for 5 and 6 players have some unique features explained below.

LINKED SPACES
-------------
The expansion contains three pairs of action spaces connected by a
gray farmer symbol and surrounded by a shared stone wall. These are:

  - Lessons / Copse
  - Lessons / Modest Wish for Children
  - House Building / Traveling Players

These are called "linked spaces."

When you place a worker on a linked space, the connected action space
becomes blocked for the rest of the round. In other words, linked
spaces are pairs of action spaces where only one of the two may be
used per round. (The revised Hungarian base game already includes one
linked space tile with 4 action spaces.)

Two of the linked spaces are accumulation spaces ("Copse" and
"Traveling Players"). If you use them, take all accumulated goods
from that space as usual. If you use the action space linked to an
accumulation space, the goods on the accumulation space remain there.

A blocked action space cannot be used by any other player that round,
but it does not count as occupied. If a card refers to an occupied
action space, it only affects spaces that actually have a worker on
them.

Example: You place a worker on "House Building." The food on the
linked "Traveling Players" space stays there. Neither you nor anyone
else may send a worker to "Traveling Players" this round -- it is
blocked.

MAJOR IMPROVEMENT CARDS (6-PLAYER GAME)
----------------------------------------
During setup for a 6-player game, place the 8 additional Major
Improvements behind the corresponding base game cards. Whenever you
build a Major Improvement, you must build from the top of the stack.
You cannot build one that is still covered by its own other copy.

Note: Except for the new Well, all additional Major Improvements are
more expensive than their base game counterparts. The new Well costs
3 stone and 1 clay (which simply differs from the original Well).
However, you must build the original (3 stone, 1 wood) before you
can build the new one.

As usual, you may build multiple copies of the same Major
Improvement -- for example, to deny them to other players. With the
exception of Fireplaces and Cooking Hearths, owning multiple copies
of the same Major Improvement provides additional benefits.

Example: You own both Joineries. At each harvest, you may convert
wood to food twice (1 wood = 2 food, done twice). During scoring,
you may spend up to 7 wood twice to earn up to 6 bonus points twice.

For all Major Improvements:
  - Apart from the building cost, they are identical in function to
    their base game counterparts.
  - A card behind another card can only be built once the card in
    front of it has been built (by any player).

THE NEW MAJOR IMPROVEMENT CARDS
--------------------------------
Fireplace (4 clay): Place this Fireplace behind the base game's
3-clay Fireplace. This Fireplace may also be exchanged for a Cooking
Hearth in the usual way. If exchanged, place it back behind the
3-clay Fireplace. (If needed, it is on the board.)

Cooking Hearth (6 clay): Place this Cooking Hearth behind the base
game's 5-clay Cooking Hearth. Naturally, a Fireplace may also be
exchanged for this Cooking Hearth.

Well (3 stone, 1 clay): If you build both Wells, place 5 food on the
round cards each time.

Clay Oven (4 clay, 1 stone): If you build both Clay Ovens, you may
also convert 2 grain into food when baking bread.

Stone Oven (2 clay, 3 stone): If you build both Stone Ovens, you may
convert up to 2x 2 grain into food when baking bread.

Joinery (2 wood, 3 stone), Pottery (2 clay, 3 stone),
Basketmaker's Workshop (2 reed, 3 stone): If you build both copies
of a craft building, you may use both during harvest to convert up to
two of the relevant resource into food. During scoring, you may also
use both separately to generate bonus points (see example above).

================================================================
ACTION SPACES
================================================================

ACTION SPACES FOR 6 AND 5 PLAYERS:

Lessons (linked with Copse): Play an occupation. The tuition is
  2 food.
Copse (linked with Lessons): Accumulation space -- 1 wood per round.

House Building (linked with Traveling Players): Build one or more
  rooms onto your house. Each room costs 5 resources of the
  appropriate type plus 2 reed. The house must be built from a
  single material type.
Traveling Players (linked with House Building): Accumulation space --
  1 food per round.

Lessons (linked with Modest Wish for Children): Play an occupation.
  The tuition is 2 food; the cost for your first and second
  occupations is reduced to 1 food each.
Modest Wish for Children (linked with Lessons): This action space may
  only be used from Round 5 onward. Family growth, but only if you
  have a room available.

ACTION SPACES FOR 6 PLAYERS ONLY:
-----------------------------------
Riverbank Forest: Accumulation space -- 1 wood per round; you also
  receive 1 reed.
Grove: Accumulation space -- 2 wood per round.
Hollow: Accumulation space -- 3 clay per round.

Animal Market: Receive one animal of your choice. If you choose
  sheep, you also receive 1 food. If you choose cattle, pay 1 food.

  1 food. You may do both, but you may not repeat the same action.
Building Supplies: Receive 1 food and two building materials. You
  must choose either reed or stone, and either wood or clay.
Corral: Receive one animal of a type you do not yet own. You must
  follow the order: you may only choose wild boar if you already have
  sheep, and you may only choose cattle if you already have wild
  boar. If you already own all three types, you may not use this
  space.
Side Job: Build exactly 1 stable for 1 wood. You may not build more
  than one stable in a single action. You may also perform a "Bake
  Bread" action.
