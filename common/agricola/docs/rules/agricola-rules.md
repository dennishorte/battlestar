## Overview

Central Europe, around 1670 AD. The Plague has finally been overcome and civilization is revitalized. Players upgrade their huts, plow fields, and raise animals. Each player starts with a farming couple in a simple two-roomed wooden hut and works to build the best farmyard over 14 rounds.

### Victory Conditions

At the end of the game, victory points are awarded for:
- Number of fields, pastures, and fenced stables
- Grain, vegetables, sheep, wild boar, and cattle
- Extension and renovation of your home
- Number of family members
- Played Occupation and Improvement cards

Players lose points for unused farmyard spaces and begging cards.

## Setup

### Game Boards
Place the three game boards in the center of the play area.

### Player Setup
Each player:
1. Chooses a color and takes all playing pieces in that color
2. Takes one farmyard board
3. Places a wooden hut room tile on each of the two building spaces
4. Places one family member disc in each room
5. Keeps remaining pieces (extra family members, fences, stables) aside

### Card Setup

**Round Cards (Blue):** Sort by stage (1-6). Shuffle each stage pile separately. Stack with Stage 6 on bottom, Stage 1 on top.

**Action Cards (Green):** Used only in 3-5 player games:
- 3 players: 4 cards
- 4-5 players: 6 cards

Place face-up beside the first game board.

**Occupation Cards (Yellow):** Remove cards not matching your player count (indicated by purple symbols). Shuffle and deal 7 to each player.

**Minor Improvement Cards (Orange):** Shuffle and deal 7 to each player.

**Major Improvement Cards (Red):** Place all 10 face-up on the Major Improvements board.

**Begging Cards (Grey):** Place beside the play area.

**Summary Cards:** Give one to each player.

## Game Structure

The game consists of **6 stages** divided into **14 rounds**:
- Stage 1: Rounds 1-4 (Harvest after Round 4)
- Stage 2: Rounds 5-7 (Harvest after Round 7)
- Stage 3: Rounds 8-9 (Harvest after Round 9)
- Stage 4: Rounds 10-11 (Harvest after Round 11)

---

## Round Structure

Each round has four phases:

### Phase 1: Start the Round
Turn over the top Round card and place it on the appropriate space. This new action is now available for this and all future rounds.

### Phase 2: Replenish
Add goods/food to all Action spaces marked with an arrow (↓). Resources accumulate if not taken.

### Phase 3: Work Phase
Starting with the starting player and proceeding clockwise:
- Take one family member from your farmyard
- Place it on an unoccupied Action space
- Perform that action immediately

Continue until all family members have been placed. Each Action space can only hold one family member per round.

### Phase 4: Return Home
All players return their family members to their farmyards.

---

## Harvest

Harvests occur at the end of each stage (after rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).

### Harvest Phase 1: Field Phase
Remove 1 grain or vegetable token from each sown field and add it to your personal supply.

### Harvest Phase 2: Feeding the Family
Pay **2 Food per family member**. Newborns (born this round) only require 1 Food.

**Converting resources to Food:**
- Grain or vegetables: 1 Food each (anytime)
- Animals: Require a Fireplace, Cooking Hearth, or other improvement with the cooking symbol
- Baking bread: Requires an improvement with the baking symbol (only during Bake bread actions)

**Begging:** If you cannot or choose not to feed your family, take 1 Begging card per missing Food. Each Begging card costs 3 points at game end.

### Harvest Phase 3: Breeding
If you have at least 2 animals of the same type, gain 1 baby animal of that type—but only if you can accommodate it. Animals breed regardless of where parent animals are located.

## Important Rules Clarifications

1. **Starting Player:** The starting player marker only moves when someone takes the "Starting Player" action.

2. **Animals cannot be stored:** Animals must be placed in your farmyard immediately or converted to Food. They cannot be held in your personal supply.

3. **Building resources can accumulate:** Wood, clay, stone, reed, grain, and vegetables in your personal supply have no limit.

4. **Pastures must be complete:** You can only build fences that create a fully enclosed pasture.

5. **Reading cards aloud:** When playing any card, read it aloud so all players are aware of its effects.

6. **Limited components:** Only family members (5), stables (4), and fences (15) are limited per player. Other components should be substituted if they run out.

7. **Unused spaces:** A farmyard space is "used" if it has a room, field, stable, or is enclosed by fences.
